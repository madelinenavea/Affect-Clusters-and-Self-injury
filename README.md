## üîç Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate how **momentary affective states** cluster into **latent profiles** and how these profiles relate to **self-injurious behaviors (SIBs)**. Using **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)** data collected over 14 days (N = 124 participants, N ‚âà 6600 observations), we aim to identify affective states associated with higher risk for SIBs.

## üß™ Methods

- **Data Type**: EMA with time-indexed affect + SIB reports
- **Participants**: Individuals reporting ‚â•3 SIBs (non-suicidal self-injury or eating disorder behaviors) in the past month
- **Analysis**:
  - **Latent Profile Analysis (LPA)** performed using `tidyLPA` and `mclust` in R
  - Model convergence issues with covariance structures led to the use of **Model 1 (equal, zero covariance)**
  - Class enumeration guided by the **K+1 rule** and **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)** ‚Äî profiles must contain ‚â•10% of sample

## üìà Results

Five latent affective profiles were identified:

| Profile | Description             | Obs Points | Total SIBs |
|---------|--------------------------|------------|------------|
| P1      | Moderate Positive Affect | 2037       | 114        |
| P2      | Moderate Affect          | 865        | 97         |
| P3      | Low Overall Affect       | 2609       | 165        |
| P4      | High Negative Affect     | 463        | 62         |
| P5      | High Positive Affect     | 626        | 34         |

### Key Insights:
- **P3 (Low Overall Affect)** exhibited the **highest frequency of SIBs**, despite low arousal.
- **P5 (High PA)** reported the **lowest SIB engagement**, suggesting PA may be a protective state.
- Surprisingly, **P1 (Moderate PA)** had the **second-highest SIBs**, implying that moderate PA alone is insufficient to mitigate SIB risk.

## ü§ñ Data Science Contributions

- Demonstrates how **unsupervised clustering (LPA)** on **time-series affect data** can yield interpretable psychological profiles.
- Highlights real-world issues in model convergence and practical solutions (e.g., fallback to simpler models).
- Explores **behavioral prediction via latent state classification**, relevant to affective computing and just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs).

## üîç Future Directions

- Test predictive validity of **pre-SIB affect profiles** vs. post-SIB.
- Integrate physiological signals or passive data for multimodal modeling.
- Apply **sequence modeling (e.g., HMM, RNNs)** to capture transitions between states over time.
